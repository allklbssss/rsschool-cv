### About me
lI am a third-year student at Voronezh State University. My field of study is computer science and computer engineering.
I am currently studying React and TypeScript. I got acquainted with React quite recently, but I mastered it quite quickly. Before React I studied JavaScript and made layouts to improve my HTML and CSS skills and got acquainted with adaptive layout. 
In RSSchool I hope to pump up my skills and find my first job.
